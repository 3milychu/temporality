0,litreview,linear,0,1.png,,The Price of the Quarter of Wheat,William Playfair,1821,"""The glorious beginning of economic fact-curves in historical time is with the work of William Playfair. He is credited with inventing the graphic method of representing statistical data and he can claim several firsts: plots of money and financial flows, graphs of social time series observations, bar charts, circle and pie graphs, and the use of statistical graphs for analysis of public policy. Playfair called  his invention ""linear arithmetic"". In The Commercial and Political Atlas, first published in 1786, Playfair used forty-four graphs to show what was and even what might be for the economy of England. For most of the graphs, the lines are smoothed over the points. Playfair: ""The advantage proposed by this method, isn ot tha of giving a more accurate statement than by figures, but it is to give a more simple and permanent idea of the gradual progress and comparative amounts, at different peiods, by presenting to the eye a figure, the proportions of which correspond with the amount of the sum intended to be expressed."" The lines become more active in Playfair's later graphs. This transition is best illustrated by Playfair's various grphs on the price of wheat.","Measurement, Quantification and Economic Analysis: Numeracy in Economics",https://books.google.com/books?id=RiuIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=The+Price+of+the+Quarter+of+Wheat+playfair&source=bl&ots=SaokwbwHle&sig=7UPphTARhnIlgGOnWbabl4Y-bQc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5q4XL5ILfAhWlg-AKHe_EDzEQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Price%20of%20the%20Quarter%20of%20Wheat%20playfair&f=false
1,litreview,narrative,0,2.png,,Napoleon’s 1812 Invasion of Russia,Charles Joseph Minard,1869,"""The illustration depicts Napoleon's army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon's troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard's interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers.[2] This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow.""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard#Information_graphics
2,litreview,cyclical,0,3.png,,Diagrams of the Causes of Mortality,Florence Nightingale,1858,"""Nightingale is described as ""a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics"", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a ""coxcomb"", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports.

3,litreview,motion,0,4.png,,The Horse in Motion,Eadweard Muybridge,1872,"""Eadweard Muybridge is famous for his pioneering work in the study of motion and early motion picture projection.  Leland Stanford, then governor of California, hired Muybridge to help him settle a bet that at some point in a horse’s gallop, all four hooves are off the ground. In 1872, Muybridge began using a complex photographic method to capture horses in motion. In 1879, he proved that indeed all four hooves of a galloping horse are off the ground during the stride. Muybridge continued his pioneering work on animal locomotion by using multiple cameras to capture movement in stop-motion photographs and also invented the zoopraxiscope - a device for projecting motion pictures that predates the perforated flexible film strip used in cinematography. During the 1880s, he worked at the University of Pennsylvania and produced over 100,000 images of animals and humans in motion, capturing movement otherwise indistinguishable to the human eye. Muybridge laid the groundwork for the motion picture industry, thereby revealing a new universe of motion.""",Lehigh University,https://omeka.lehigh.edu/exhibits/show/data_visualization/galleria/muybridge
4,litreview,narrative,0,5.png,,A New Chart of History,Joseph Prisetley,1769,"""n 1769, 18th-century British polymath Joseph Priestley published A New Chart of History and its prose explanation as a supplement to his Lectures on History and General Policy.[1] Together with his Chart of Biography (1765), which he dedicated to his friend Benjamin Franklin), Priestley believed these charts would allow students to ""trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner.As Arthur Sheps in his article about the Charts explains, ""the horizontal line conveys an idea of the duration of fame, influence, power and domination. A vertical reading conveys an impression of the contemporaneity of ideas, events and people. The number or density of entries . . . tells us about the vitality of any age.""[4] Voids in the chart indicated intellectual Dark Ages, for example.""",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Chart_of_History
