# Designing Temporality

This is a project that explores data visualizations of temporality in three parts:

## Literature Review
A literature review on the inventions and history behind the traditional devices we  use to visualiez time-bound datasets

## Design Research
A collection of visualizations that contribute to the dialectic of exploring how temporality can be visualized digitally

## Playground
Using dat.gui.js, a playground allows interactors to upload their own time-bound datasets and visualize temporality in different ways to imagine how perceptions can be expanded.
